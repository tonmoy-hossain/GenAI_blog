## In this session, our blog covers papers related to foundation models copyright infringement, founding over five-fold topics.
1. Foundation Models and Fair Use
2. Copyright Plug-in Market for The Text-to-Image Copyright Protection
3. Extracting Training Data from Diffusion Models
4. A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT
5. Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models


## Paper A. Foundation Models and Fair Use

### A.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Objectives and Motivations

+ Existing foundation models are trained on copyrighted material
+ Deploying these models can pose both legal and ethical risks
+ If the model produces output that is similar to copyrighted data, fair use may no longer apply to the output of the model

The authors emphasize that fair use is not guaranteed, and additional work may be necessary to keep model development and deployment squarely in the realm of fair use.

1. Survey the potential risks of developing and deploying foundation models based on copyrighted content.
	+ Experiments confirm that popular foundation models can generate content considerably similar to copyrighted material
2. Discuss technical mitigations that can help foundation models stay in line with fair use
	+ more research is needed to align mitigation strategies with the current state of the law
3. Suggest that the law and technical mitigations should co-evolve
